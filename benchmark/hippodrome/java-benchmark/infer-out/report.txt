pingpong/BuggedProgram.java:87: warning: Thread Safety Violation 2
  Read/Write race. Non-private method `BuggedProgram.pingPong()` reads without synchronization from `this.pingPongPlayer`. Potentially races with write in method `BuggedProgram.pingPong()`.
 Reporting because the current class is annotated `@ThreadSafe`, so we assume that this method can run in parallel with other non-private methods in the class (including itself).
