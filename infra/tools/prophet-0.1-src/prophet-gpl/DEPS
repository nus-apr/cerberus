To build our tool, we need:
llvm with clang 3.5.0
libz

for properly build benchmarks, we need to install:

re2c, bison for building php-deps
libglib2.0-dev for building lighttpd
textinfo for gmp
autopoint and cvs for gzip
libgtk2.0-dev, libqt4-dev, libgtk-3-dev, libpcap-dev for wireshark
libncurses5-dev for python

32bit ubuntu, existing fbc binary, libgpm-dev, libncurses-dev, libiberty-dev,
binutils-dev, libxpm-dev, libcunit1-dev, and libgtk2.0-dev for fbc
