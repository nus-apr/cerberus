"no suspicious expressions localized"
is okay if the failing test case does not fail in golden version,
if it does fail, then it is an error.
-> check in C3 (fastest way)


### M1	"number of enumerated/explored patches"
number of expressions that are located
--> how many of them have been generated

Search term:
(considering suspicious)

Note that whole search space can the identified by searching for:
(selected expressions)


### M2	"number of patches non-compilable"
Always zero because of the controlled synthesis.


### M3  "number of patches in-plausible"
-> calculated: M3 = M1 - M2 - M3


### M4  "number of plausible patches"
-> search for "fixing expression"
-> or number of generated files


### M5	"number of correct patches"
-> manually check top-10 plausible patches
-> there will be only one patch per location


### M6	"order of generation of correct patch"
-> there is only one patch per location so it is about the location
ranking which is reflected in the output.log in the order of patch generation
and there is also a "score", for which one can search.

For example: "selected expressions [(472, 8, 473, 26)] with group score 1.0"


### M7	"rank of the correct patch"
see M6


### M8	"time until correct patch is identified"
At the end of the output.log there is a comment with the time if there was a
succesful patch generation.
