### M1	"number of enumerated patches"
Check "candidates evaluated" in the output.log

Search Term:
candidates evaluated


### M2	"number of patches non-compilable"
Always zero because of the transformation schema.


### M3  "number of patches in-plausible"
M3 = M1 - M2 - M4


### M4  "number of plausible patches"
Check "plausible patches:" in the output.log

Search Term:
plausible patches


### M5	"number of correct patches"
Check the directory "patches" Note that the patch file name provides the ranking.
patchScore_patchGenOrder-xxx.patch. Using the command "ls -v" we can sort the patches and combining with "head" command
we can filter the top-10 using the command "ls -v | head -n10"



### M6	"order of generation of correct patch"
Patch file name provides the order of the patch generation as
patchScore_patchGenOrder-xxx.patch


### M7	"rank of the correct patch"
The order in the filtered list using the command  "ls -v | head -n10"


### M8	"time until correct patch is identified"
The time for generation would the time needed for the full exploration and
is the same for all plausible patches. Time can be measure since the log contains timestamps.
