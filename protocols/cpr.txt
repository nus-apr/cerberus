### M1	"number of generated patches"
Number of (concrete) plausible patches after synthesis.
Check "Run time statistics:" at the end of the output.log

Search Term:
Patch Explored Count


### M2	"number of patches non-compilable"
Always zero because of the controlled synthesis.


### M3  "number of patches in-plausible"
M3 = M1 - M2 - M4


### M4  "number of plausible patches"
Number of (concrete) plausible patches after refinement.
Check "Run time statistics:" at the end of the output.log

Search Term:
Patch End Count


### M5	"number of correct patches"
Check the generated output/patch-set-ranked-X (X will the iteration where the
patch set was generated). You can pick the file with the highest iteration.
You check check the variable mapping in the instrument.sh script. Note that the
generated output are the abstract patches, so you need take the parameters into
account. Only check the first 10 patches.


### M6	"order of generation of correct patch"
= represents ranking (only check first 10 patches)


### M7	"rank of the correct patch"
Check Patch number in patch-set-ranked-X.


### M8	"time until correct patch is identified"
The time for generation would the time needed for the initial synthesis and
is the same for all plausible/generated patches. Check "Run time statistics:"
at the end of the output.log

Synthesis

Note: time given in seconds in the sheet, the log gives in minutes
