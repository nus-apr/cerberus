### M1	"number of generated patches"
Number of (concrete) plausible patches after synthesis.


### M2	"number of patches non-compilable"
Always zero because of the controlled synthesis.


### M3  "number of patches in-plausible"
Always zero because of the controlled path synthesis. Only plausible patches
will be generated.


### M4  "number of plausible patches"
Number of (concrete) plausible patches after refinement.


### M5	"number of correct patches"



### M6	"order of generation of correct patch"
= represents ranking (only check first 10 patches)


### M7	"rank of the correct patch"


### M8	"time until correct patch is identified"
