### M1	"number of enumerated/explored patches"
"find_best_edit" at the end of the summary, or the last id of the variant that was generated
the patch space is defined at the beginning of logs with "possible edits"


### M2	"number of patches non-compilable"
count the occurrences of  "fails to compile"


### M3  "number of patches in-plausible"
-> calculated: M3 = M1 - M2 - M4



### M4  "number of plausible patches"
GenProg only generates one patch, so plausible patches are either 0 or 1


### M5	"number of correct patches"
-> manually check top-1 plausible patch
-> there will be only one patch



### M6	"order of generation of correct patch"
-> there is only one patch, so order is either nill or 1



### M7	"rank of the correct patch"
-> there is only one patch, so order is either nill or 1


### M8	"time until correct patch is identified"
At the end of the output.log there is a stat for the total time elapsed
